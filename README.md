# MW-MyBB-Languages

This is the repository for languages used by modworkshop.net

If you wish to add your language, that is possible!

First, search and download your language here: https://community.mybb.com/mods.php?action=browse&category=19 
Then, copy paste the files that don't exist in the language folder into that folder and translate those (For example mydownloads.lang.php). Speaking of mydownloads.lang.php, do not translate the rules.

Have fun!

P.S.: If you have any issues or questions, open an issue or contact us thrugh the mws Discord: https://discordapp.com/invite/Eear4JW
